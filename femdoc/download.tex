The source code of the model is provided in a file named |\shydist|
or similar, depending on the version of the code. In this case the
version is \version.  The file can be downloaded from the SHYFEM
web-site\footnote{http://www.ismar.cnr.it/shyfem/}, or by contacting
directly its authors.

Once you have downloaded the model distribution, move the file to
the directory in which you want to install the model and unpack the
distribution. This can be achieved with the following commands:

\begin{codem}
    mv \shydist dir
    cd dir
    tar -xzvf \shydist
\end{codem}

At this point a new folder named |\shydir| has been created. 
This directory is the root of the SHYFEM model. All other commands
given in this chapter assume that you are in this directory. 
Therefore, before reading on, please move into this directory:

\begin{codem}
    cd \shydir
\end{codem}
