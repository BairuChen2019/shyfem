subdry.f:

transfer setzev zetznv from subdry to newtra or similar
delete zuniq
znv exchanged in setznv

prtouv
uvtopr
uvtop0
make_prvel	->	calls uvtopr, uvtop0
init_uv		->	difference to init_uvt

setnod:
	indicate also ghost nodes (not boundary)
	exchange is already done

setarea:
	why also called in sedi3d?
	exchanges

check if rhov, bpresv have to be exchanged
	probably no
	bpresv may be eliminated

init_coriolis
	must exchange for aver, min, max

subdif:
	smagorinski needs uprv, vprv
	green will not work -> need neigboring element

tracer:
	with tracer adjust set_advect...
	massconc -> only run over inner nodes
		then exchange

system:
	check that we are running explicit

check:
	wprv(0:nlv)?		probably can do without 0
	upro, vpro used? 	used in gotm
	xv used?		try to eliminate

still to check with shympi_check:
	* depth
	* levels
	geom		impossible
	* geom_dynamic
	* evgeom

check set_timestep
	how is dt set

check
        module mod_bound_dynamic
        real, allocatable, save :: rzv(:)
        real, allocatable, save :: rqv(:)
        real, allocatable, save :: rqpsv(:)
        real, allocatable, save :: rqdsv(:)
        real, allocatable, save :: mfluxv(:,:)

compute_heat_flux
	should go into meteo forcing

total_energy
	reduce element value

check:
	ppv
	tauxnv,tauynv
	rdistv
